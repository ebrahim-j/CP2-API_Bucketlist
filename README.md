# CP2-API_Bucketlist
According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a Bucket List is a list of things that one has not done before but wants to do before dying. This app creates an API for an online Bucket List service using Flask.


#### GETTING STARTED:

1. Clone Repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ebrahim-j/CP2-API_Bucketlist.git
    ```
2. Navigate to local directory.

    ```
    $ cd CP2-BucketList_API
    ```
3. Create a virtualenvironment(assuming you have virtualenvwrapper).

    ```
    $ mkvirtualenv -p python3 venv
    ```
4. Install all app requirements

    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Create the database and run migrations

    ```
    $ python manage.py create_db [name]
    ```

**To run migrations**:
   `$ python manage.py db init`

   `$ python manage.py db migrate`

   `$ python manage.py db upgrade`

Don't forget to set your APP_SETTINGS to set your app configurations, you can choose from:
    - development
    - testing
    - production
    - staging
    #e.g.
    `$ export APP_SETTINGS='development`

 6. All done! Now, start your server by running `python manage.py runserver`. For best experience, use a GUI platform like [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to make requests to the api.
